# Security Recommendations

## Vulnerability Report Summary
Multiple security vulnerabilities were identified. The most critical include missing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, increasing the risk of XSS attacks; hidden files being accessible, potentially exposing sensitive information; and missing anti-clickjacking headers, making the application vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. Additionally, there are several low severity issues related to missing security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Expect-CT), information disclosure through comments, cache control directives, and uncommon headers. Finally, the use of 'deflate' content encoding might expose the server to BREACH attacks. These vulnerabilities could arise from misconfigurations, outdated software, or insufficient security awareness during development.

Please review the report and address the vulnerabilities manually.
