# Security Recommendations

## Vulnerability Report Summary
Multiple security vulnerabilities were identified. The most critical include missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and anti-clickjacking headers, which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking attacks. The presence of hidden files may expose sensitive information. Other identified issues include missing X-Content-Type-Options and X-XSS-Protection headers, potentially leading to MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities and XSS attacks. Informational findings consist of suspicious comments, cache control directives, and general information about the web application. Uncommon headers were also found. Finally, the Content-Encoding header is set to "deflate" which may expose the server to BREACH attack.

Please review the report and address the vulnerabilities manually.
